    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "By inspecting from the data exploration above, I would put my concern on thoughts:\n",
    "1. There are so many categorical features that have been encoded into sparse column. So, need to explore more algorithm with this character\n",
    "2. Despite of those sparse features, the final data now has 103 feature columns. Hence, algorithm with capabilities of learning with a lot of features is more considered\n",
    "\n",
    "From that thoughts, I list 3 supervised learning models which may works better than any other listed model above:\n",
    "1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * __Real world application:__ One real world application of SVM would be on image classification problem. Using SVM's capability of utilizing a lot of feature, it would be outperform other simple classifiers.\n",
    "    * __Strengths of the model:__ Support Vector Machine has the ability to do `kernel tricks` that let the model to catch data features and transform it in particular way. \n",
    "    * __Weakness of the model:__ The `kernel tricks` also give SVM a weakness since it really depends on us as data scientist to choose the right *kernel* and *regularization* parameters, especially when the features are more than the sample.\n",
    "    * __Why this is a good candidate:__ Considering number of features of the data which don't come to its weakness, therefore I assume SVM will work fine.\n",
    "    * __reference:__ [scikit-learn SVM](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "    * __Real world application:__ In medical worlds, Random Forest can be used to determine the right components in a medicine and to identify diseases by analyzing patient's medical record.\n",
    "    * __Strengths of the model:__ Since random forest comprises multi decision tree, it's more likely to avoid overfitting. It's also can be used to determine the most important feature in feature engineering process.\n",
    "    * __Weakness of the model:__ Multi decision trees in random forest make it significantly slow to predict and hence it's time consuming.\n",
    "    * __Why this is a good candidate:__ I think random forest as one of ensemble methods is worth to try since the problem is about classification. Furthermore, it's just a binary classification although with 103 features.\n",
    "    * __reference:__ [DataCamp Community](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/random-forests-classifier-python#advantages) and this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@Synced/how-random-forest-algorithm-works-in-machine-learning-3c0fe15b6674)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "    * __Real world application:__ From references, AdaBoost can be applied in *Face Detection* problem and also *player detection* in a basketball game.\n",
    "    * __Strengths of the model:__ AdaBoost offers good accuracy and handle a lot of features well.\n",
    "    * __Weakness of the model:__ Although AdaBoost offers good accuracy, it's realy sensitive to noise and really slow when training the model.\n",
    "    * __Why this is a good candidate:__ Based on the problem itself, which is focus on its accuracy, and considering the strengths of the model, AdaBoost will give good accuracy.\n",

    "Based on the problem, that is identify individuals that take more than $50,000 as potential donor candidate, here **AdaBoost Classifier** was implemented. In a nutshell, **AdaBoost Classifier** is an ensemble method that try to boost several machine learning to get better performance. That being said, it tries to boost every model in a particular estimator by focusing on the missclassified one for the next particular estimators. Hence, it will generally boost the performance of the combined model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using default settings in _scikit-learn_, AdaBoost was implemented using base estimator _DecisionTreeClassifier_. As the problem tries to emphasize accuracy of the solution, _AdaBoost Classifier_ offer really good accuracy. Moreover, by looking at the above metrics evaluation, its performance is consistent both when training and testing set is used. Therefore, __AdaBoost Classifier__ may work well for this kind of problem."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
